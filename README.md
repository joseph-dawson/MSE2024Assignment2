Android Studio Kotlin app for Mobile Software Engineering in Fall 2024

Project is split into 2 classes: MainActivity.ky and SecondaryActivity.kt

MainActivity.kt contains the code, text, and buttons for the main screen
SecondartActivity.ky contains the code, text, and button for the second screen

Got to work on android studio emulator, using system image API 35 on a Medium Phone
